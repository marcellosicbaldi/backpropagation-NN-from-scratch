# backpropagation-NN-from-scratch

Implementation of the backpropagation algorithm in Python using only numpy.

The effectiveness of the implementation is verified by proving the universal approximation theorem: any neural network architecture can find any mathematical function y= f(x) that can map attributes(x) to output(y)
